AKA: Piano Conductor

Many people have thought about the idea of "air guitar", "air drum", and there has been many researches into this domain (like Guitar Hero, Piano Genie, Radio Baton, and many more..)

I intend to focus on "piano", the instrument I love the most. My vision is to create something like an "air piano". I believe there is unnecessary pain in the effort to master this difficult instrument. We need to spend hundreds of hours to make sure there's no significant wrong note during performance, although playing the correct notes is only a very small proportion of the art of piano playing. 

I feel the music I want in my mind. Is there any better way to get it out, other than 40 hours of practicing everyday?

Can technology and machine learning be the wings of human imagination and expressivity?
